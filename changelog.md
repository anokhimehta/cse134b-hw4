## Here are the changes I made: 

1. I made my contact form significantly cleaner using what I learned from this homework.
2. I linked my nav buttons to the appropriate sections on my page
3. Improved some padding and margins and sizing to make the overall website look cleaner and easier to read
4. I set up a Google Analytics API to help understand how users are using my website. In terms of future projects, I can see this being used to track customer behavior to help better a webapp over time.
